</h3>

<p>Two common multiplayer algorithms are the paranoid (Sturtevant and Korf, 2000) and the max<sup>n</sup> (Lockhardt and Irani, 1986). The question I have is, which will be better in a game of Hearts?</p>

<a id="about-this-project" class="anchor" href="#about-this-project" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>About This Project</h3>

<p>The purpose of this project is to find if the paranoid or max<sup>n</sup> algorithm is the better player at Hearts. The project contains three types of players: paranoid, max<sup>n</sup>, and random. With these three players, I will be able to evaluate the playing capabilities of each algorithm.</p>

<p>The max<sup>n</sup> algorithm, created by Lockhardt and Irani, is a tree search-type algorithm. It assumes that all players are trying to maximize their own personal score. The crucial point in writing this algorithm is creating good tie-breaking strategies. The downside to the max<sup>n</sup> algorithm is that it can't easily be pruned.</p>

<p>The paranoid algorithm, created by Sturtevant and Korf, is a minimax algorithm. This algorithm assumes all players are trying to give it the worst score possible, so it must pick a branch that has the best return for itself. The thing that give the paranoid algorithm its edge over the max<sup>n</sup> algorithm is it can use alpha-beta pruning. The downside is if you search too far into the tree, the algorithm can become worse.</p>

<a id="the-reason-why" class="anchor" href="#the-reason-why" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>The Reason Why</h3>

<p>I wanted to take up this project because most of the good game algorithms are for two-player games. While I don't think I will have any breakthroughs for multiplayer game algorithms, I can find which one of these algorithms is better.</p>
