{"name":"Hearts - Paranoid vs Maxn algorithms","tagline":"Paranoid vs Maxn","body":"### Paranoid vs. Max<sup>n</sup>\r\nTwo common multiplayer algorithms are the paranoid (Sturtevant and Korf, 2000) and the max<sup>n</sup> (Lockhardt and Irani, 1986). The question I have is, which will be better in a game of Hearts?\r\n\r\n### About This Project\r\nThe purpose of this project is to find if the paranoid or max<sup>n</sup> algorithm is the better player at Hearts. The project contains three types of players: paranoid, max<sup>n</sup>, and random. With these three players, I will be able to evaluate the playing capabilities of each algorithm.\r\n\r\nThe max<sup>n</sup> algorithm, created by Lockhardt and Irani, is a tree search-type algorithm. It assumes that all players are trying to maximize their own personal score. The crucial point in writing this algorithm is creating good tie-breaking strategies. The downside to the max<sup>n</sup> algorithm is that it can't easily be pruned.\r\n\r\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rustyfetty/Hearts-Algorithms/master/Photos/MaxTree.png)\r\n\r\nThe paranoid algorithm, created by Sturtevant and Korf, is a minimax algorithm. This algorithm assumes all players are trying to give it the worst score possible, so it must pick a branch that has the best return for itself. The thing that give the paranoid algorithm its edge over the max<sup>n</sup> algorithm is it can use alpha-beta pruning. The downside is if you search too far into the tree, the algorithm can become worse.\r\n\r\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rustyfetty/Hearts-Algorithms/master/Photos/ParanoidTree.png)\r\n\r\n### The Reason Why\r\nI wanted to take up this project because most of the good game algorithms are for two-player games. While I don't think I will have any breakthroughs for multiplayer game algorithms, I can find which one of these algorithms is better.\r\n\r\n### How I'm Doing So Far\r\nThe graphs below show how my algorithms are doing so far.\r\n\r\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rustyfetty/Hearts-Algorithms/master/Photos/Scores30Games100000.png)\r\n\r\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rustyfetty/Hearts-Algorithms/master/Photos/AverageTimePerMove30Games100000.png)\r\n\r\n### Author\r\nRussell Fetty (@rustyfetty)\r\nThank you to the creator of PyHearts for a platform from which to begin.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
